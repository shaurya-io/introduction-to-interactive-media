### Journal Entry #1: Preliminary Thoughts 

For the purpose of the midterm project in this course, I am interested in exploring Google's [Teachable Machine Tool](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/), which allows in-browser recognition for sounds, images, and body poses. 

At present, I have two ideas in my head, and both seem quite appealing. The first is a Kinect-style dancing game which uses Teachable Machine to check if the user is following along with the dance moves on the screen, and thereby scoring in accordance with the accuracy of user coordination. The only potential drawback in this idea is that I am not a dancer myself, so even though I may train the model using elementary moves, I wouldn't enjoy the game much.

The second idea is to create a Rock-Paper-Scissor bot, which alternates randomly between the three poses and scores by recognizing the user pose and comparing it to its own pose using the set of rules for the game.
