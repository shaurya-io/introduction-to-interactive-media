## Creating a Musical Instrument 

For this project, while most of my peers decided to create devices that could play simple notes and were more or less derivatives of different types of keyboards, I decided to lead my investigation in a slightly different direction: musical progression. Progression is the quality of music which involves a crescendo of melodies leading to a satisfying conclusion, or in the youth's slang, a **drop**. Hans Zimmer, one of the most celebrated composers of our time who rose to fame creating background scores for films like Inception, Interstellar, and the Dark Knight franchise, is very famous for his progression-style music that invokes suspense, adding a new layer of depth and grit to the films he works in.

This project takes one of his famous background scores from Interstellar, and uses a sonic distance sensor to create an instrument where the progression of the tune can be controlled using a piece of paper and varying its distance from our "instrument".
