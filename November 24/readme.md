## Communicating between Arduino and Processing via Serial.print()

For this assignment, I decided to make a sonar-esque system that uses the sonic distance sensor mounted on top of a servo motor. The distances and angles are then printed out in the Serial channel and communicated to Processing, where we can 'graph' these values into a visual system that resembles a sonar.

The hardware for this project looks like this:
