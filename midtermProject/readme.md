My midterm project started with an exploration of Google's Teachable Machine, but landed at a Processing-based recreation of the famous online game, Agar.io.

## Agar.io, the Internet Sensation:

The objective in Agar.io is simple - survive for as long as possible in a battle-royale format game where every player is given a small circular body. You can grow your body by eating food scattered all over the Agar.io world, as well as by eating other players (very similar to the snake game, in that aspect). The only caveat is that you can only attack and eat players with bodies smaller than your circle, meaning you need to constantly watch your back to make sure no bigger circle is coming to eat you!

## My Adaptation:

It goes without saying that making a real-time battle royale game that supports multiple players is outside the scope of this project, and quite frankly my abilities as well. Therefore, I decided to adapt my version into a Player v Computer model, where the player's body spawns into a universe full of food and one AI-enemy. The objective, then, is to eat as much food as possible in order to grow bigger and eat the AI-enemy. Or, be eaten and you lose.
