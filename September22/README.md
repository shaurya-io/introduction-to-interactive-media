For this project, I was inspired by the patterns in the 5-dimensional tesseract featured in Christopher Nolan's Interstellar (2014). Therefore, I decided to pay homage to the imagery using the film's soundtrack (originally composed by Hans Zimmer) as a varying parameter upon which I drew moving grids to recreate the tesseract.
