### Journal Entry #1: Preliminary Thoughts as of November 26, 2020

During the course of working on the previous weekly assignment, in which I presented a DIY sonar system using a sonic sensor mounted on top of a servo motor, I slowly stumbled upon the idea of making a game out of it, where the task for the player would be to beat the sonar system and get to the center. I imagine that this could be done in an empty room, such as the lounge of my suite. In addition, to make the game harder, I plan to procure another sonic sensor in order to build a more efficient system that traces a 360-degree space, and this will be placed in the center of the room.

Other elements I am thinking of introducing are a buzzer to signify Game Over, as well as a puzzle on the breadboard in the center which needs to be solved while the sonar is active. I am also considering adding a set of proper speakers to the setup and learning how to play music using Arduino, to give the entire project a Mission Impossible like feel.
