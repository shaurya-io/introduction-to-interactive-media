For this weekly assignment, I chose to make a puzzle consisting of 3 switches and 3 LEDs. Both of these had one each of Red, Green and Blue, with every LED software-wise connected to the switch of the same color.

The schematic for the circuit is as follows:

At the beginning of the puzzle, the 3 LEDs flash 5 times in a random pattern (say RGBRB). If the user punches the buttons in the exact same order, all the LEDs light up - signifying a successful attempt. This is followed by another pattern.
