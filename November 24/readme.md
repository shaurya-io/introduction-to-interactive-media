## Communicating between Arduino and Processing via Serial.print()

For this assignment, I decided to make a sonar-esque system that uses the sonic distance sensor mounted on top of a servo motor. The distances and angles are then printed out in the Serial channel and communicated to Processing, where we can 'graph' these values into a visual system that resembles a sonar.

The hardware for this project looks like this:

On the Processing side, the output looks like this:

### This is also the idea I intended to pursue further for my Final Project - in fact, I began working on it right after the demo for this weekly assignment which is why I couldn't upload the standalone code for the sonar demo in this folder, as it had already been heavily modified by the time I realized my forgetful mistake. 

To take a look at the final version of this project, I invite you to check out my finalProject folder, where this demo has been combined with an onboard puzzle to create a (albeit a bit cliched) "bomb-diffusing" experience.
