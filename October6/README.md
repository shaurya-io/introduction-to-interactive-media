This project was inspired by Australian daredevil Felix Baumgartner, who is famous for the highest skydive in history from roughly 128,000 ft, or ~39km. His stunt led me to imagine if he undertook this endeavor on another planet in our solar system, or even our very own moon. How much faster would he fall?

As an artistic touch, one can also enable an oscillating gravitational field by un-commenting two lines of code which are highlighted in the codebase itself. This was a particular challenge for me to begin with, but I managed it with the right combination of a while loop and a counter variable.

Attached is a screenshot of the project:
