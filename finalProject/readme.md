### Using an Ultrasonic Sensor to create a Bomb Diffusal Puzzle Game

Following on from my previous weekly assignment in which I had demo'd a makeshift sonar system, I fleshed the idea out into a full-fledged game. The concept of this game is simple: evade the sonar system while solving an on-board puzzle. If you're detected by the sonar, a buzzer buzzes and you lose the game; on the flipside, if you get 7 combinations on the puzzle correctly, you win and successfully disarm the bomb.

This project uses an ultrasonic distance sensor, 4 buttons, 3 LEDs, a servo motor, and a piezo buzzer. The schematic for the project can be seen below:
